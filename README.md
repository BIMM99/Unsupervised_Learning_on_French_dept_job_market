# Unsupervised Learning on French *département's job market

Within the ML class during my MSc in interntional economics (2020-2021), I had to do an exploratory analysis of job market data agregated at the *département* level.

## What we did:

- variable selection and aggregation at *département level* to best descibe the job market
- using different unsupervised model to give a good description of the data

## In this repo:
- a `.Rmd` file with the code and the explanations
- a `.pdf` file as the report (output of the `.Rmd`)
